/*
*
*
all the HACKS and QUICK FIXES go here
*
*
1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
2. Document all hacks fully:
    - Related to: What part of the codebase does it relate to?
    - Why: Why was this needed?
    - Possible Solution: How might you fix it properly, given more time?
3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
